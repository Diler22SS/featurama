## ðŸ§  **Project Overview: Feature Selection Sandbox for Biostatistical Data Analysis**

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This application is a **local-use web-based platform** designed to support **exploratory feature selection** in biostatistical datasets. It serves as a **sandbox** that enables domain experts to interactively experiment with different combinations of feature selection methods â€” providing both flexibility and reproducibility â€” while preserving a structured pipeline. 

The goal is not to suggest "best" methods, but to provide a **modular framework** where biostatisticians can analyze the impact of method choices on model outcomes and feature explainability.

---

## ðŸ§ª **Pipeline Structure**

The application enforces a **fixed pipeline architecture**, with user-defined methods at each step:

```
[Manual Pre-Selection] âž¡ [Filter] âž¡ [Wrapper] âž¡ [Model] âž¡ [Explainability]
```

Each stage performs a clearly defined transformation on the dataset:

1. **Manual Pre-Selection (Initial Step)**
   - The user loads a dataset and **manually selects initial features** based on domain knowledge.
   - No automation or filtering is applied here; this step serves as a starting point.

2. **Filter Stage**
   - Methods include statistical or information-theoretic filters (e.g., variance threshold, correlation filtering, chi-squared, mutual information).
   - Removes obviously uninformative or redundant features.

3. **Wrapper Stage**
   - Methods like stepwise selection or recursive feature elimination using weak learners (e.g., shallow decision trees).
   - Subsets of features are evaluated using model performance metrics.

4. **Model Training**
   - A single model is trained using the feature subset selected from the wrapper stage.
   - **XGBoost** is the default algorithm for model training (others may be integrated later).

5. **Explainability**
   - Model is interpreted using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to compute local and global feature importance.
   - Visual and tabular reports are generated for analysis.

## ðŸ§° **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: Web-based UI (framework-agnostic here, but could be React, Vue, etc.)
  - Forms for method selection at each stage
  - Summary tables and SHAP visualizations
- **Backend**: Python-based logic for data handling, method execution, and pipeline control
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** (local instance)
  - Stores datasets, experiment configurations, method choices, SHAP values, and results
- **Explainability Engine**: SHAP library for model interpretation
- **Modeling**: `xgboost` + `scikit-learn` for model training and wrappers

## ðŸ“‚ **Database Schema (Simplified)**

Main tables:

| Table             | Purpose                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `datasets`        | Metadata and reference to stored datasets |
| `experiments`     | Each pipeline execution, linked to dataset |
| `feature_methods` | Stores selected methods per experiment stage |
| `results`         | Accuracy scores, model metrics, SHAP summaries |
| `shap_values`     | Feature-level SHAP outputs (optional caching) |

## ðŸ§¾ **Usage Assumptions & Constraints**

- The program is intended for **local use only** (no multi-user or cloud access)
- **Users must manually select initial features** before starting the pipeline
- **No default methods are pre-selected** â€” user must explicitly choose methods per stage
- **Reports are automatically generated and fixed in format** (i.e., no customization options)
- All experiment configurations are stored for reproducibility and retrieval
- The tool is intended for **exploration and hypothesis support**, not final clinical model deployment

---

## ðŸ§  Developer Notes

- Each pipeline run is **logged with a hash or ID** for reproducibility
- Modular architecture allows easy **plug-in of new filter/wrapper/methods**
- SHAP outputs are stored as structured JSON or DataFrames for UI rendering
- Visualization layer should support:
  - SHAP summary plots (bar, beeswarm)
  - Feature importance tables
  - Method comparison views
